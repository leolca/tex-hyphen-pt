\begin{abstract}
    Portuguese hyphenation rules are available for more than 35
    years and have done a good job. Nonetheless they still make mistakes and
    leave some hyphenation points unmarked. Although most undetected
    hyphenation points are located near word boundaries, what will be
    irrelevant for \TeX{} typographic purposes, they are still useful to
    hyphenate proper nouns, new words or pseudoword, and for usage in other
    applications, such as text-to-speech conversion. A list of
    \DictionarySize{} hyphenated words acquired from online dictionaries was
    used along \emph{patgen} to create improved rules, leading to better hyphenation
    of Portuguese words.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}
Hyphenation in text wrapping was not used for a long time. Words should fit
entirely in a line, or they would be broken in arbitrary places. First no
marker at all was used to sign the wrapping of a word, what could create
confusion and undesirable meaning. Therefore, ortographers advocated for the
use of a sign to indicate this break. Portuguese faced the same gradual
introduction of a hyphenation sign to mark words wrapping across lines. Even
though the usage of a hyphenation sign ($=$) was advocated by orthographers
\cite{gandavo1574}, few documents used such sign until the end of the 18th
century \cite{araujo2015}.

In some cases, hyphenation hinders smooth reading and should be avoided in
child literature, for example. In opposition, large or small spaces between
words also impose difficulty in the reading process, making hyphenation
fundamental when texts use short line lengths. As a line gets shorter, the
number of breaking candidates between words decreases, leading to awkward
spaces between words and among letters. For that matter, automatic hyphenation
plays an important role in good typesetting.

%Automatic hyphenation plays an important role in good typesetting and
%it is fundamental when a text uses short line lengths. As a line gets
%shorter, the number of breaking candidates between words decreases,
%creating awkward spaces between words and among letters.

\TeX{} is a typesetting system which carefully deals with these issues,
automatically arranging text on a page to create a good reading experience.
Automatic hyphenation is an important part on this process,
promoting an even-tempered distribution of elements on the page.
%Hyphenation is therefore an important part on this process.
%A good readability depends on an even-tempered distribution of elements
%on the page.
Line height and length, paragraph length, font size and typeface,
letter and word-spacing, are some factors which influence the text legibility
and readability. Space between words should not be too long creating lakes and
rivers in the text, nor too tight, impairing the legibility and readability.

Another important matter to consider is ambiguities that might be created when
a word is partitioned during the hyphenation process. In English we should
avoid hyphenations such as \emph{re-cover}, \emph{re-form}, \emph{re-sign}, \emph{the-rapist},
\emph{depart-mental}, and \emph{mans-laughter} (in Portuguese, some examples are:
\emph{de-putada}, \emph{fede-ração}, \emph{acu-mula}, \emph{após-tolo},
\emph{cú-bico}). Hyphenations that might lead the reader to pronounce a word
incorrectly should also be prevented. That is the case of
\emph{considera-tion}, in Enslish (and \emph{pe-rigo} in Portuguese).

In some situations, hyphenation is also a matter of style. Some partitioning
choices sound better than others. These conflicting alternatives typically
arises when a words has many possible hyphenation points. Consider
\emph{ar-chae-ol-o-gist} (\emph{or ar-che-ol-o-gist}), which is preferably partitioned as
\emph{archae-ologist} (or \emph{arche-ologist}) in opposition to \emph{archaeol-ogist} (or
\emph{archeol-ogist}) or \emph{archaeolo-gist} (or \emph{archeolo-gist}). It is preferable to keep
whole morphemes together. In the previous example: \emph{archae} (or \emph{arche}, meaning
``ancient'', ``primitive'')
%\footnote{archae- comes from the Ancient Greek ἀρχαῖος (arkhaîos, `ancient',
%`primitive'), from ἀρχή (arkhḗ, `beginning').}
%https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/archae-
and \emph{-ologist} (``one who studies the topic''). In Portuguese, it is also more
elegant to avoid splits between double consonants or vowels, even if an
hyphenation point do exists between those letters. For example,
\emph{pressu-rizar} is preferable over \emph{pres-surizar} and
\emph{empreen-dedor} is preferable over \emph{empre-endedor}. Even so,
exceptions exists, it is preferable to partition \emph{micro-organismo}
rather than \emph{microor-ganismo} (keeping morphemes together is favored
over splitting a double vowel).

The general rule for Portuguese hyphenation is to split a word into its
syllables. A syllable is made of a mandatory nucleus, filled by a vowel, and
optional peripheral consonants (before or after the nucleus). In some
situations, the syllabic division does not respect the ethnologic constituents.
The usage of the prefixes \emph{bis-} and \emph{in-} are examples of this
circumstance. The correct syllabifications are \emph{bi-sa-vô},
\emph{i-na-ti-vo}, and \emph{i-nobs-tan-te}\footnote{The rule of syllable
division could lead to two possible partitions: \emph{i-nobs-tan-te} and
\emph{in-obs-tan-te}, but the first is preferable.}, where the prefixes are
split into two syllables. But, as pointed previously, it is preferable to keep
morphemes together rather than splitting them apart, therefore the we should
favor the hyphenation \emph{bisa-vô} over \emph{bi-savô} and \emph{ina-tivo}
over \emph{i-nativo}. This last example could also lead to a misunderstanding
since the word \emph{nativo} (\emph{native} in English) emerges from this word
break. 

Each language has its own hyphenation rules. They might be grouped into two
groups: those which hyphenation is driven by morphology (etymology) and those
driven by pronunciation. An algorithmic approach might use a logic system to
analyse words and apply the hyphenation rules of a given language. An algorithm
must be written for each language, as hyphenation rules vary extensively.
Although a logic system might be fast and compact, inevitably it will have to
deal with exceptions through hard-coded rules.

The automation of this process might use a dictionary based approach, which
will restrict the hyphenation possibilities to those entries in the dictionary,
an algorithmic base approach, which might be applied to whatever sequence found
in a text, or a mix of both approaches. 
%An algorithmic approach might use a logic system to analyse words and apply
%the hyphenation rules of a given language. 
A rule base model might include the recognition of prefixes,
suffixes, morphemes, or some sequences suitable for the inclusion of a break.
Another approach is the usage of pattern matching. Given a corpus of
hyphenation examples in a language, it is necessary to identify those sequence
of letters that define a point where hyphenation is suitable or not. Patterns
might include prefixes, suffixes, exceptions and special hyphenation rules of a
given language. Such approach might be used for different languages, by
providing hyphenation examples in a target language to extract patterns and
rules.

Only the analysis of immediate surrounding might not be enough to determine a
potential break point. For example, consider \emph{dem-o-crat} and \emph{de-moc-ra-cy},
where immediate surrounding of \emph{e} does not suffice to determine the break
location. Even after chosen patterns that makes hyphenation pretty
straightforward, there might be exceptions. Consider the sequence \emph{tion}. It
seems safe to always place a break before this pattern. However, the word
\emph{cation} is hyphenated as \emph{cat-ion}, making is etymology determinant to the way
this word will be split. 

A word with different meanings may be hyphenated differently according to its
meaning. `For instance, the Swedish word form \emph{glassko} has three different
meanings, and can be hyphenated as \emph{glas-sko} (glass shoe),
\emph{glass-ko} (ice cream cow) and in the non-standard way,
\emph{glass-sko} (ice cream shoe).' \cite{nemeth2006}. In Portuguese, the
word \emph{sublinha} might be hiphenated in two different forms:
\emph{su-bli-nha} when representing the inflected form of verb
\emph{sublinhar} (underline as a verb) or \emph{sub-li-nha} when refering
to the line under (underline as a noun).

% hyphenation might change with syntactic function
% part of speech (PoS)

Machine learning approach was used by to hyphenate Norwegian text
\cite{kristensen2001}. It was found that the \TeX{} approach, in general,
performed better then a neural network. Both approaches had similar
performance on finding the correct hyphenation points and avoiding wrong
hyphenation points on a small word list (the neural network performed slightly
better on finding the correct hyphenation points). Nonetheless, \TeX{} approach overcame
the neural network on a large word list, regarding the avoidance of wrong
hyphenations.

The original \TeX{} hyphenation algorithm was introduced by Knuth 1977
\cite{knuth1977}. It was focused on the English language and used three main
rules:(1) suffix removal; (2) prefix removal; and (3)
vowel-consonant-consonant-vowel (VCCV) breaking. Tests showed it could find
40\% of the allowed hyphen locations \cite{liang1983}. The hyphenation
algorithm proposed by Frank M. Liang and adopted in \TeX{} uses the notion of
competing patterns. A database of hyphenated words is swept, looking for
hyphenating and inhibiting patterns. The algorithm introduced in \TeX{}82 uses
five alternating levels of hyphenating and inhibiting patterns. The program
for patten generation, based on a corpus, PATGEN was created Liang
\cite{liangbreitenlohner1999} and was used to create hyphenating patterns for
many languages
\cite{sojka1995,sojka1995a,sojka2005thesis,sojka2003,scannell2003}.

The effective hyphenation of words by \TeX{} will actually depends on the following factors:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item document language, which will determine which set of patterns to apply;
    \item characters used, since some might block hyphenation at their edges;
    \item the value of the internal variables \verb|lefthyphenmin| and \verb|righthyphenmin|\footnote{
	The variables \verb|lefthyphenmin| and \verb|righthyphenmin| are language dependant and
	are defined in \emph{tlpobj} files (\verb|/usr/local/texlive/20XX/tlpkg/tlpobj/hyphen-xxxxxx.tlpobj|). 
	Default values varies in the range from 1 to 3. 
    	English and Portuguese, for example, use \verb|lefthyphenmin=2| and \verb|righthyphenmin=3|.},
	% ls /usr/local/texlive/2023/tlpkg/tlpobj/*.tlpobj | while read -r filename; do grep -Po "lefthyphenmin=[0-9]\s+righthyphenmin=[0-9]" $filename; done | tr '\t' ' ' | tr -s ' ' | sort | uniq -c
	%      17 lefthyphenmin=1 righthyphenmin=1
        %       6 lefthyphenmin=1 righthyphenmin=2
        %       1 lefthyphenmin=1 righthyphenmin=3
        %      49 lefthyphenmin=2 righthyphenmin=2
        %       9 lefthyphenmin=2 righthyphenmin=3
        which defines the minimum sequence length of characters at the left and right borders
        before any hyphenation is allowed.
\end{enumerate*}

Despite the fact that \TeX{} hyphenation algorithm and rules are old, they are,
to these days, the most frequently used even outside the \TeX{}'s world. The
grounds for this is Hunspell, a spell checker and morphological analyzer that
is adopted in may software (e.g. LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox,
Mozilla Thunderbird, Google Chrome, macOS, InDesign, memoQ, Opera, Affinity
Publisher, among others \cite{hunspell}). Hunspell uses \TeX{} hyphenation
rules \cite{hunspellhyphen,levien1998}, making \TeX{} hyphenation widespread in
the computer world. That is a result of \TeX{} approach simplicity and
versatility.  The algorithm works well, it currently has rules for 66 languages
\cite{texhyphenrules} and it is possible to design new rules for those still
missing.

Unfortunately, some specific hyphenation rules are not possible to be
implemented using the \TeX{} hyphenation algorithm. In German, for example,
when words are hyphenated, some letters might change or a letter might be
inserted.  Compound words have no hyphens, leading to long sequences of letters
with no visible separation and even repetitions of a same letter, such as in
\emph{Wasserrinne} and \emph{Schifffahrt}. Furthermore, the German spelling
reform made some changes, making it necessary to create a different set of
rules for German hyphenation.  For example, the word \emph{Schiffahrt} should
be hyphenated as \emph{Schiff-fahrt}, preserving the \emph{f}s from each word
that makes this compound. The hyphenation should insert a \emph{f} that is not
part of the written form. That was not a problem for the old written form of
the word: \emph{Schifffahrt}. Also, the old hyphenating rules of German grammar
stated the hyphenation \emph{Bäk-ker} for the word \emph{Bäcker},
\emph{Zuk-ker} for the word \emph{Zucker} and \emph{pak-ken} for the word
\emph{packen}. Now those words are hyphenated as \emph{Bä-cker}, \emph{Zu-cker}
and \emph{pa-cken}, respectively. Some words have also changed their
hyphenation point after the spelling reform. For example, \emph{Fen-ster}
became \emph{Fens-ter} and \emph{mei-stens} became \emph{meis-tens}. Some
problems in compound word hyphenation in \TeX{} are discussed in
\cite{sojka1995a}.


% Some hyphenation rules are not possible with TeX algorithm.
% For example, the german word Schiffahrt should be hyphenated as Schiff-fahrt.
% Although it is no longer the recommend written form, it was the most usual
% until 2003 (see graph in schifffart.png from google ngrams).
% Also the old hyphenating rules of German grammatic stated the following
% hyphenations Bäk-ker (for the word Bäcker, what is now hyphenated as Bä-cker),
% Zuk-ker (for the word Zucker, what is now hyphenated as Zu-cker),
% pak-ken (for packen, and now pa-cken) and trok-ken (for trocken, now tro-cken).


%which contain archeo can be alternatively spelt with archaeo or archæo.

\section{Patterns for \TeX{} hyphenation}\label{sec-patt4TeX} 
The patterns used in \TeX{} hyphenation are of the form: \texttt{4z1z2}. Each
pattern is made of a sequence of letters and numbers. Odd numbers indicate a
good hyphenation point, whereas even numbers indicate a bad place to break.
The given example states that the sequence has a good breaking point between
the first and the second \emph{z} and an hyphenation should be inhibited before
the first \emph{z} and after the second \emph{z}. For example, the hyphenation
of the word \emph{piz-za}, \emph{fiz-zle} and \emph{mez-zanine} use this rule,
where we see the hyphen placed between the two \emph{z}'s and no hyphen before,
nor after the \emph{z}'s. The pattern may also use period symbol (\emph{.}) to
indicate word boundaries. The pattern \texttt{.s2h2} applies to beginning of
words, implying that the \emph{s} and the \emph{h} should stick together in
beginning of a word and an hyphenation should also be inhibited after the
\emph{h}. For example, this pattern is used in \emph{Sher-lock}.

Hyphenation rules are organized in levels, from 1 to 9, where odd numbers
represent hyphenating levels and even numbers represent inhibiting levels. Each
level works as an exception level of it predecessor. For example, the rule
\texttt{sh1er} indicate a good hyphenation point between the \emph{h} and the
\emph{e} in the sequence \emph{sher}. A rule at a higher level, as
\texttt{.s2h2}, implies an exception to the lower level rule. When we see
\emph{sher}, in the beginning of a word, the rule \texttt{.s2h2} applies and
hyphenation proposed by the lower level rule \texttt{sh1er} should be hindered.
That is the case in the hyphenation of the word \emph{Sher-lock}. The full
example is provided in \Cref{sherlockhyphenation}, where we might see all
English rules that takes place in the hyphenation of \emph{Sher-lock}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={}, caption={Example of rules applyied in the
hyphenation of the word \emph{Sherlock}. Example done using a port of \TeX{}'s
hyphenation algorithm to Go provided at

\end{lstlisting}


A pattern will consist of a string made of characters (from the language
alphabet) possibly with a number in between, expressing the
hyphenation/inhibition level and possibly word boundaries marker (the period)
at the pattern edges. When there is no number between characters in a pattern,
a zero is assumed, which means \emph{undefined} and no hyphenation point will
be suggest at that location.



\section{PATGEN}\label{sec-patgen}
PATGEN uses a list of hyphenated words to define rules at different
levels and lengths, based on the patterns found in the data. It start with
short patterns and increases until a maximum pattern length, allowed by the
user, is reached. As it advances, creating longer patterns, it also establishes
exceptions. In some cases, the analysis of long patterns might be necessary,
since some hyphenation points might depend on characters far away from the
breaking point\footnote{Some examples of hyphenation dependency on characters
far from the break point: \emph{dem-o-crat} and \emph{de-moc-ra-cy};
\emph{as-pi-rin} and \emph{aspir-ing}; \emph{de-mon-stra-tive} and
\emph{dem-on-stra-tion}.}.


PATEGEN works on glyph indices rather than character codes. Each glyph is
represented by a single byte. That amount to 256 indices, where 13 of them are
reserved for the digits 0-9 and the characters `.', `-' and `*'. The remaining 243
are used to represent symbols of the given language. To run PATGEN, it is required a
translation file, which defines the values of some language specific parameters
(in the first line) and defines the many forms in which language symbols might
appear (all following lines). In the first line, positions 1 and 2 are used to
set the value of \verb|lefthyphenmin|, positions 3 and 4 are for
\verb|righthyphenmin|. These values defines the shortest length of a string
that might be generated by an hyphenation procedure. In order to set a single
digit value, leave the first position blank, that is, put a blank space in
position 1 and 3 for \verb|lefthyphenmin| and \verb|righthyphenmin|
respectively. Positions 5, 6 and 7 are used to define alternative values for
the special characters `.', `-' and `*'. The following lines uses a delimiter
to surround each `letter' of the desired language alphabet and also its
alternative representations. The first position of the line defines the
delimiter and each symbol of the language may use as many positions as
necessary, since not using the value reserved for the delimiter. Consider the
example for defining the letter `e' in Portuguese: 
\begin{verbatim}
XeXEXéXêXÉXÊX\'{e}X\^{e}X\'{E}X\^{E}XX 
\end{verbatim}
It represents the many ways in which it might be found: lowercase, uppercase,
with or without acute or circumflex accents. In this definition, we have
assumed that the many forms in which we may find the character \emph{e} and
\emph{e} will be equivalent for hyphenation (pattern matching) purpose. As
another example, see the line defining the character $\pi$ (taken from
\cite{haralambous2021}): \begin{verbatim} #p#P#\varpi ## \end{verbatim}

The translate file and the dictionary file should use the same encoding. Even
if it is a multi byte encoding, the translation file express how to deal with a
sequence of bytes representing a glyph and PATGEN will work fine as long as
there are at most 243 symbols in the given language.
The dictionary file is a list of already hyphenated words from which PATGEN
will look for patterns and create hyphenation rules. 

Those rules are organized
in different levels, from 1 to 9, where odd numbers represent hyphenating
levels and even numbers represent inhibiting levels. Each level works as an
inhibiting level of it predecessor. 
%A pattern will consist of a string made of
%characters (from the language alphabet) possibly with a number in between,
%expressing the hyphenation/inhibition level and possibly word boundaries marker
%(the period) at the pattern edges. When there is no number between characters
%in a pattern, a zero is assumed, which means \emph{undefined} and no
%hyphenation point will be suggest at that location.




\section{\TeX{} hyphenation rules for portuguese}\label{sec-tex-hyphen-pt}

\cite{rezende1987} created the first patters for Portuguese hyphenation in
\TeX{}. It was lastly updated in 2015 with the contributions from José João
Dias Almeida \cite{hyphpt}. The set has \NumberOfDefaultRules{}
rules\footnote{The set of rules for Portuguese hyphenation is short when
compared to rules in other languages. For example, English currently has 4938
rules, Russian has 7023 rules and German has 34011 rules.} and are able to
correctly hyphenate the majority of Portuguese words. 
% - detalhar as regras de Rezende e Dias 
% - contabilizar a quantidade de palavras que não são contempladas pela proposta do autor
% - analisar a necessidade de excluir alguma regra (ao invés de apenas acrescentar novas)

In front of these cases, we propose here to analyse the performance of the default rules in order to add new rules to improve
hyphenation by correcting some issues and taking in account non-typical
patterns. We describe the methodology used in the section \ref{sec-methodology}.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec-methodology}

In order to apprise the performance of each set of rules, we need a list of
correctly hyphenated words that are used in Portuguese. For that, we use the
frequency of occurrence to avoid selecting really rare words. To build a large
list with such information, we relied on data collected from online
dictionaries and corpora of Portuguese. We also looked up Portuguese grammars
to check on the hyphenation (\emph{translineation}) rules and we made some manual
corrections on the data.


\subsection{Data collection}\label{sec-data-coll} 

Initially we selected \href{https://www.linguateca.pt/cetenfolha/index_info.html}{CETENFolha} 
as the source corpus. Using only this corpus led to two problems: many words
were still missing and it was built on text from 1994, prior to the
Orthographic Agreement. This problem is a result of the Orthographic Agreement
of the Portuguese Language, carried out in 1990. 

The Agreement's adopting transition period started in 2009 and ended as it
turned mandatory in 2016.  Even after the agreement, some words still hold
different spellings in the participant countries. It is desirable to have
hyphenation rules that might work properly, despite those idiosyncrasies.  For
example, the word \emph{reception} might be written as \emph{receção}
(Portugal) or \emph{recepção} (Brazil); the word \emph{action} might be written
as \emph{acção} (Portugal) or \emph{ação} (Brazil); and the word \emph{project}
might be written as \emph{projecto} (Portugal) or \emph{projeto} (Brazil).

% We have used the Portuguese Wikipedia dump as our Portuguese corpus. Texts in Wikipedia might be written by Brazilian or Portuguese contributors, the both spellings may appear.

% cat /ms/downloads/samples/wikipedia/ptwiki-latest-pages-articles-multistream_wordlist.txt | tr -dc '0-9\n' | paste -sd+ | bc

% cat /ms/downloads/samples/wikipedia/ptwiki-latest-pages-articles-multistream_wordlist.txt | awk '{CUMCOUNT+=$1; if(CUMCOUNT < 287115158) print;}' >/tmp/ptwikitop95.txt

Because of these idiosyncrasies, we decided to incorporate the list of words from
\href{https://www.palavras.net/}{Palavras NET} and afterwards we also included
words from the \href{https://pt.wikipedia.org}{Portuguese Wikipedia} dump.
Although the list of words created was huge, we kept only those words we could
find their hyphenation on at least one of the following online dictionaries: 
\href{https://michaelis.uol.com.br/}{Michaelis},
\href{https://dicionario.priberam.org/}{Priberam},
\href{https://pt.wiktionary.org}{Wikcionário},
\href{https://aulete.com.br/}{Aulete},
\href{http://www.portaldalinguaportuguesa.org/}{Portal da Língua Portuguesa} e
\href{https://www.dicio.com.br/}{Dicio}.
This leads to the creation of a dictionary with \DictionarySize{} words.

Table \ref{tblstats} presents the number of words with a given number of
hyphenation found in the dictionaries. It also presents the number of words
that have the highest agreed hyphenation. For example, the word \emph{como}
was hyphenated by the six dictionaries as \emph{co-mo}. It will add one to the
counts on both lines where the hyphenations number is 6 (first column). The
word \emph{sua} was hyphenated as \emph{su-a} in 4 dictionaries, \emph{sua} in
one dictionary and one dictionary did not provide its hyphenation. Therefore,
it will add one in the first line, second column (since hyphenations were found
in 5 dictionaries). It will also add one on the second line, third column
(since the most frequent hyphenation was found in 4 dictionaries). It is clear
now why we might have the number of same hyphenations (specially for small
values) greater the number of hyphenations found. 


\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Considering the six dictionaries used, the first line of this table
presents the number words that a given number of hyphenations were found in the
dictionaries. The second line presents the number of words that have a given
number of hyphenation as its most frequent form found in the
dictionaries.}\label{tblstats}

\begin{tabular}{*{8}{l}}

    \NumberOfFourAgrees{} & \NumberOfThreeAgrees{} & \NumberOfTwoAgrees{} &
    \NumberOfOneAgrees{} & n/a
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In summary, data from \emph{CETENFolha} and \emph{Palavras NET} were compiled.
Their words were hyphenated based on the hyphenation original \TeX{} rules and
contrasted with the dictionary results. The performance was appraised and the
errors systematized, in order to find in the literature possible rules that
could complement and improve it.


\section{Writing systems}\label{sec-writing-systems}

There is a wide range of writing systems. They might be categorized into
logographic, syllabic, and alphabetic writing systems.  Although they are
distinct categories, writing systems might be built on an interplay of these
categories \cite{coulmas2003}. The principles that guide an alphabetic writing
system or a phonemic writing system can vary significantly based on the
specific language and its history. Nevertheless, we might highlight here some
of its key points:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item the most usual principle consists on representing the sounds of a
	language with written symbols, using one or a combination of symbols to
	represent each sound (e.g. the orthographic system of Portuguese uses
	an alphabet of 27 letters that aim to represent different sounds of the
	language); 
    \item etymology also plays an important role, where the
	spelling of a word reflects its origins and history (e.g. the French
	language often reflects the Latin roots of words in its spelling);
    \item morphology is used as a guide in structuring many languages, where
	they use specific letters or symbols to indicate word endings,
	prefixes, or suffixes (e.g. Russian uses different forms of the
	Cyrillic alphabet to indicate gender and case in its nouns); 
    \item the way a language has evolved over time also contribute to its 
	written form (e.g. the spelling of many English words have changed 
	over time to reflect changes in pronunciation);
\end{enumerate}
The principles that guide orthographic systems for languages with logographic
writing systems like Chinese ideograms, cuneiform writing, and Egyptian
hieroglyphs differ significantly from those of alphabetic writing systems. In
logographic writing systems, individual symbols or characters represent entire
words or ideas rather than phonemes or sounds. As a result, the principles that
guide their orthographic systems are based more on semantic and visual
principles rather than phonemic principles.


\section{Grammar rules for hyphenation in Portuguese}\label{sec-grammar-port}

Portuguese uses an alphabetical writing system, ensuing that its spelling is
guided by phonological principles \cite{cagliari2015}. The fact that spelling
reflects, to some extent, the way words are pronounced, means that the
hyphenation of words is also influenced by the phonemic system, where words are
divided into syllables. It is noteworthy that different languages divide words
based on different principles, for example, English tends to be guided by
morphological principles, such as \emph{walk-ing}, \emph{un-happy},
\emph{work-s}, and \emph{ear-ly}. Also, other factors affect word hyphenation in
English, such as the presence of doubled consonants and digraphs\footnote{One
should not confuse consonant clusters with digraphs, since the latter represent
only one sound, while the former represent two or more sounds.}. There are also
a myriad of exceptions that might be grasped into rules.
% https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/385/what-are-the-rules-for-splitting-words-at-the-end-of-a-line

Merely stating that an orthographic system is guided by phonological issues
does not necessarily mean that its hyphenation rules directly reflect the way a
word is pronounced -- this is because Portuguese does not have a direct
letter-sound correspondence, and vice versa.  The orthographic system operates
according to its own specific rules. For instance, although consonant clusters that
produce a single sound (i.e., digraphs) are pronounced within a single syllable
in words like \emph{chave}, \emph{ilha}, \emph{shampoo}, \emph{carro}, and
\emph{pássaro}, their representation in writing determines how they are
separated.  Specifically, different consonants within a digraph must remain
together, while identical consonants are separated. As a result, we have
\emph{cha-ve}, \emph{i-lha}, and \emph{sham-poo}, but \emph{car-ro}.

%When there is no space left in line for a whole word, it might be split in two
%using a hyphen as an indication of such procedure. 

In Portuguese, hyphenations are allowed on syllables boundaries and, in
general, follow phonological principles.  According to the Grammar
\cite{cunha2016,bergstrom2011,cegalla2008}, some rules might still apply:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{rule-di-triphthong} diphthong or triphthong should not be split
	(e.g. \emph{m\underline{\emph{ui}}-to}, \emph{Pa-ra-g\underline{\emph{uai}}});
    \item\label{rule-unstressed} the sequences \emph{ia}, \emph{ie}, \emph{io}, \emph{oa}, \emph{ua},
	\emph{ue} and \emph{uo}, when in final unstressed position, should not be split 
	(e.g. \emph{gló-r\underline{\emph{ia}}}, \emph{vi-tó-r\underline{\emph{ia}}}, 
	\emph{cá-r\underline{\emph{ie}}}, \emph{es-pé-c\underline{\emph{ie}}}, 
	\emph{Má-r\underline{\emph{io}}}, \emph{má-g\underline{\emph{oa}}}, 
	\emph{ré-g\underline{\emph{ua}}}, \emph{tê-n\underline{\emph{ue}}}, 
	\emph{con-tí-g\underline{\emph{uo}}}, \emph{am-bí-g\underline{\emph{uo}}});
    \item\label{rule-c-clusters} consonant clusters starting a syllable should not be
	split (e.g. \emph{\underline{\emph{pn}}eu-má-ti-co}, \emph{\underline{\emph{ps}}i-có-lo-go}, 
	\emph{\underline{\emph{mn}}e-mô-ni-co});
    \item\label{rules-digraphs-ns} the digraphs	\emph{ch}, \emph{lh}, \emph{nh}
	should not be split (e.g. \emph{ra-\underline{\emph{ch}}ar},
	\emph{a-bro-\underline{\emph{lh}}os}, \emph{ma-\underline{\emph{nh}}ã};
    \item\label{rule-guqu} bigrams like \emph{gu} and \emph{qu} whose vowel \emph{u} is not 
	pronounced are never separated from the vowel or diphthong that follows it 
	(e.g. \emph{ne-\underline{\emph{gu}e}}, \emph{pe-\underline{\emph{qu}e}});
    \item\label{rule-nasalization} since they are digraphs, a vowel and its following 
	nasalization marker (a graphic nasal consonant) should not be split (e.g. \emph{\underline{\emph{am}}-bição},
	\emph{m\underline{\emph{an}}-cha});
    \item\label{rule-decreasing} decreasing diphthongs should not be split (e.g. 
	\emph{\underline{\emph{ai}}-ro-so}, \emph{ca-d\underline{\emph{ei}}-ra}, 
	\emph{o-ra-ç\underline{\emph{ão}}});
    \item\label{rule-rising} rising diphthong should not be split (e.g.
	\emph{a-b\underline{\emph{ai}}-xo}; \emph{c\underline{\emph{au}}-te-la}, 
	\emph{pa-p\underline{\emph{éi}}s}, \emph{cha-p\underline{\emph{éu}}}, 
	\emph{pre-f\underline{\emph{ei}}-to}, \emph{r\underline{\emph{eu}}-nir},
	\emph{n\underline{\emph{oi}}-te}; \emph{ca-la-b\underline{\emph{ou}}-ço}, 
	\emph{as-te-r\underline{\emph{ói}}-de}; 
	\emph{re-tri-b\underline{\emph{ui}}});
    \item\label{rule-singlev} disyllables whose syllable has a single vowel should 
	not be split (e.g. \emph{\underline{\emph{a}}to}, \emph{ru\underline{\emph{a}}}, 
	\emph{\underline{\emph{ó}}dio}, \emph{\underline{\emph{u}}nha});
    \item\label{rule-orphan} words with more than two syllables, when divided, cannot 
	isolate a syllable composed of a single vowel (e.g. \emph{\underline{\emph{a}}gos-to}, 
	\emph{la-go\underline{\emph{a}}}, \emph{\underline{\emph{i}}da-de});


    \hspace{10em} \hbox to 5cm{\leaders\hbox to 10pt{\hss . \hss}\hfil} 

    \item\label{rule-hiatus} hiatus vowels and those vowel sequences where each vowel
	belongs to a different syllable should be split (e.g.
	\emph{sa\underline{\emph{-ú-}}de}, \emph{ra\underline{\emph{-i-}}nha}, \emph{d\underline{\emph{o-e}}r},
	\emph{v\underline{\emph{o-o}}s}), the same procedure is used splitting diphthongs
	in different syllables (e.g. \emph{c\underline{\emph{ai-ai}}s}) or diphthong and
	vowel in different syllables (e.g. \emph{en-s\underline{\emph{ai-o}}s});
    \item\label{rule-consonants} consonant sequences, when in different syllables, should
	be split (e.g. \emph{a\underline{\emph{f-t}}a}, \emph{a\underline{\emph{b-d}}i-car},
	\emph{re\underline{\emph{s-c}}i-são}, \emph{a\underline{\emph{b-s}}o-lu-to});
    \item\label{rule-digraphs} the following consonant digraphs should be split:
	\emph{rr}, \emph{ss}, \emph{mm}, \emph{nn}, \emph{sc}, \emph{sç} and
	\emph{xc} (e.g. \emph{te\underline{\emph{r-r}}a}, \emph{pro-fe\underline{\emph{s-s}}or},
	\emph{co-mu\underline{\emph{m-m}}en-te}, \emph{co\underline{\emph{n-n}}os-co},
	\emph{de\underline{\emph{s-c}}er}, \emph{cre\underline{\emph{s-ç}}a}, \emph{e\underline{\emph{x-c}}e-der}).
\end{enumerate}

Note that rules \ref{rule-singlev} and \ref{rule-orphan} are fiddling rules in \TeX{} hyphenation, 
since \TeX{} already has directives to avoid hyphenated widows and orphans. 
As mentioned in \Cref{sec-intro}, the variables \verb|lefthyphenmin| and \verb|righthyphenmin|
are used to control the minimum length for fragments of hyphenated words.
This is the ground why we will not consider rules \ref{rule-singlev} and \ref{rule-orphan}
when analysing and elaborating the hyphenation rules.


In some situations a hyphen should be repeated in the start of the following
line: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item when a compound word using a hyphen is split across lines (e.g.
    \emph{couve-/-flor}, \emph{ex-/-presidente});
\item when a different meaning could be conveyed when splitting a pronoun (e.g.
    \emph{prazer de ver-/-me}\footnote{Possible conveyed meanings: 
    \emph{pleasure in seeing me} or \emph{worm's pleasure}.}). 
\end{enumerate}

It should be avoided to leave a single vowel in the end or start of a line (e.g.
the word \emph{san-guí-nea} should be split only on the hyphen gave in the
example, avoiding the split that would leave the final vowel \emph{a}
left alone in the start of a new line: \emph{sanguíne-a}). It is also considered a better approach
to avoid splitting disyllables made of four letters (e.g. \emph{para},
\emph{como}, \emph{cede}).


Systematizing the rules that guide syllable boundaries and, consequently,
hyphenation in Portuguese proved to be fundamental for the improvement of the
\TeX{} hyphenator rules, since they indicate the possible or prohibited contexts
of hyphenation. Expomos, a seguir, uma análise comparativa...

\section{Creating the dictionary}
A \emph{bash} script was created to crawl on six online dictionaries and extract a word hyphenation, when found. 



\section{Updating the rules}


\subsection{Results from the new set of rules}
Although the XXX erroneous words have some common characteristics, which would
allow, to some extent, to reduce the amount of hyphenation errors, there is a
limitation arising from the way \TeX{}'s rules are conceived. We present,
below, the systematists found in these data that could be predicted by another
structure of rules:

\begin{description} 
    \item[Morphological determination:] Prefixes such as \emph{re-},
	\emph{sub-}, \emph{cyber-}, and \emph{auto-} require separating the
	prefix from its stem, what runs into phonological issues. For example,
	\emph{reiniciar} and \emph{sublinhar}, as they contain prefixes, should
	be hyphenated as \emph{re-i-ni-ci-ar} and \emph{sub-li-nhar},
	respecting the morphological formation of the word. However,
	considering that the Portuguese language hyphenates its words from
	syllabic phonological correlates, words that require morphological
	information, such as those, do not have their hyphenation performed
	properly. They add up, in our corpus, to twelve words (eight words with
	\emph{re-} and one case with \emph{auto-}, \emph{meta-}, \emph{sub-},
	\emph{cyber-}, \emph{geo-} or \emph{neuro-}).

    \item[Foreignness:] There is a group of 20 words in the corpus that are
	terminologies or words that were incorporated into the Portuguese
	language without full phonological adaptation, such as
	\emph{darwinismo}, \emph{quilowatt}, and \emph{esfiha}. The lack of
	adaptation makes the phonological pattern very specific to the word,
	making it impossible to incorporate in \TeX{}'s rules alongside the
	other rules. The solution is to add them to the exception word list.

    \item[Word-initial consonant clusters:] Portuguese has few cases of
	consonant clusters at the beginning of a word. They, in general, are
	etymological remnants and are currently unproductive in the language,
	since there are no neologisms with this pattern. Encounters like
	\emph{ps-} and \emph{pn-} are more frequent, as they are present in
	words like \emph{psicologia} and \emph{pneu}, which have an average
	frequency in the language. They might be predicted by rules, which
	comprise XXX words. However, there are consonant clusters that are
	found in very specific and low frequency words. Although possible, it
	is not worth adding very specific rules using the consonant clusters
	contained in the words \emph{dzeta}, \emph{gnu}, \emph{cnidário},
	\emph{ftálico}, and \emph{gnaisse} -- that is, just five words.

    \item[Abbreviations, Acronyms, or Initialisms:] Whether for efficiency, 
	convenience, clarity or jargon, it is usual the usage of a shortening 
	version of a word or a phrase. 
	Abbreviation a way to shorten a word of phrase. Some examples in our
	Portuguese corpus are: 
	\emph{etc.}\footnote{Latin expression \emph{et cetera}, meaning 
	`and other similar things'.}, 
	\emph{Dr.}\footnote{\emph{doutor} (doctor, person with PhD title, but popularly used to designate an erudite individual)}, 
	\emph{Exmo.}\footnote{\emph{Excelentíssimo} (honourable)},
	\emph{cap.}\footnote{\emph{capítulo} (chapter)}, \emph{Univ.}\footnote{Universidade (university)}, 
	\emph{ed.}\footnote{\emph{edição} (edition)}, 
	\emph{s.n.}\footnote{sine nomine, Latin expression meaning `without a name', 
	mostly used in the context of publishing.}.
	Initialism consists of a set of initial 
	letters of words that form an shortened version. They are not always 
	understood by the set of hyphenation rules described in this work, 
	since they do not follow orthographic (or phonotactic) standards of 
	the language. In the corpus, it is possible to find some abbreviations, 
	such as \emph{SESC}\footnote{Serviço Social do Comércio}, 
	\emph{INSS}\footnote{\emph{Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social} (National Institute of Social Security)}, 
	\emph{PCdoB}\footnote{\emph{Partido Comunista do Brasil} (Communist Party of Brazil)},
	\emph{PM}\footnote{\emph{Polícia Militar} (military police)}, and 
	\emph{UFRJ}\footnote{Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro}.
	Acronym is a type of abbreviation that shortens a phrase by combining
	the first letter (or letters) of each word, creating a new pronounceable word.
	Some example from the corpus are: 
	\emph{Anatel}\footnote{\emph{Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações} (National Telecommunications Agency)},
	\emph{Ovni}\footnote{\emph{Objeto voador não identificado} (unidentified flying object - UFO)},
	\emph{Sida}\footnote{\emph{Síndrome da Imunodeficiência Adquirida} (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome - AIDS)} (in Portugal) and
	\emph{Mercosul}\footnote{\emph{Mercado Comum do Sul} (Southern Common Market).}.
\end{description}


\section{Creating a new set of rules using Patgen}



\section{Comparing the set of rules} 
Let us remember that the standard \TeX{} hyphenation rules, proposed by
\cite{hyphpt}, amount to XXX errors, in a set of XXXX words.  Among those, XXX
correspond to places where the hyphenation was not carried out and XXX to
mismarkings. Faced with the errors made by the standard hyphenator, a set of
\NumberOfNewRules{} rules were established, which reduced the errors to XXXX,
with XXXX unmarked hyphenation places and XXX mismarkings.  Such rules are
presented and exemplified below, as well as the necessary exception rules and
an example in which the application of the rule is demonstrated.

O conjunto de \NumberOfNewRules{} regras é apresentado a seguir:
\begin{multicols}{4}
    \verbatiminput{patch.TeX.pt-br.patterns}
\end{multicols}

A Tabela \ref{tab-resultados} apresenta os erros cometidos no conjunto das
37798 palavras analisadas. As palavras omitidas são aquelas que foram
hifenizadas corretamente pelos dois conjuntos de regra. Utilizamos aqui a
marcação adotada pelo \emph{Patgen}: \texttt{*} para indicar pontos de
hifenização corretamente marcados, \texttt{.} para indicar pontos de hifenização
marcados erroneamente e \texttt{-} para indicar pontos de hifenização não
encontrados. Os pontos marcados erroneamente e aqueles não encontrados são
considerados erros. Quando ocorre algum erro de hifenização, marcaremos a
palavra com \xmark. Quando não houver erro algum, marcaremos a palavra com
\cmark. Ao final, podemos verificar que as regras padrão apresentaram 1368 erros
(3,62\%) e as novas regras 132 erros (0,35\%).
