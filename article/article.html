<h1 class="title">Improving the portuguese hyphenation rules</h1>

<div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
<p>Portuguese hyphenation rules are available for more than 35 years and
have done a good job. Nonetheless they still make mistakes and leave
some hyphenation points unmarked. Although most undetected hyphenation
points are located near word boundaries, what will be irrelevant for TeX
typographic purposes, they are still useful to hyphenate proper nouns,
new words or pseudoword, and for usage in other applications, such as
text-to-speech conversion. A list of hyphenated words acquired from
online dictionaries was used along <em>patgen</em> to create improved
rules, leading to better hyphenation of Portuguese words.</p>
</div>
</header>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Hyphenation in text wrapping was not used for a long time. Words
should fit entirely in a line, or they would be broken in arbitrary
places. First no marker at all was used to sign the wrapping of a word,
what could create confusion and undesirable meaning. Therefore,
ortographers advocated for the use of a sign to indicate this break.
Portuguese faced the same gradual introduction of a hyphenation sign to
mark words wrapping across lines. Even though the usage of a hyphenation
sign (<span class="math inline">=</span>) was advocated by orthographers
<span class="citation" data-cites="gandavo1574"></span>, few documents
used such sign until the end of the 18th century <span class="citation"
data-cites="araujo2015"></span>.</p>
<p>In some cases, hyphenation hinders smooth reading and should be
avoided in child literature, for example. In opposition, large or small
spaces between words also impose difficulty in the reading process,
making hyphenation fundamental when texts use short line lengths. As a
line gets shorter, the number of breaking candidates between words
decreases, leading to awkward spaces between words and among letters.
For that matter, automatic hyphenation plays an important role in good
typesetting.</p>
<p>TeX is a typesetting system which carefully deals with these issues,
automatically arranging text on a page to create a good reading
experience. Automatic hyphenation is an important part on this process,
promoting an even-tempered distribution of elements on the page. Line
height and length, paragraph length, font size and typeface, letter and
word-spacing, are some factors which influence the text legibility and
readability. Space between words should not be too long creating lakes
and rivers in the text, nor too tight, impairing the legibility and
readability.</p>
<p>Another important matter to consider is ambiguities that might be
created when a word is partitioned during the hyphenation process. In
English we should avoid hyphenations such as re-cover, re-form, re-sign,
the-rapist, depart-mental and mans-laughter (in Portuguese, some
examples are: <em>de-putada</em>, <em>fede-ração</em>,
<em>acu-mula</em>, <em>após-tolo</em>, <em>cú-bico</em>). Hyphenations
that might lead the reader to pronounce a word incorrectly should also
be prevented. That is the case of <em>considera-tion</em>, in Enslish
(and <em>pe-rigo</em> in Portuguese).</p>
<p>In some situations, hyphenation is also a matter of style. Some
partitioning choices sound better than others. These conflicting
alternatives typically arises when a words has many possible hyphenation
points. Consider ar-chae-ol-o-gist (or ar-che-ol-o-gist), which is
preferably partitioned as archae-ologist (or arche-ologist) in
opposition to archaeol-ogist (or archeol-ogist) or archaeolo-gist (or
archeolo-gist). It is preferable to keep whole morphemes together. In
the previous example: archae (or arche, meaning ancient, primitive) and
-ologist (one who studies the topic). In Portuguese, it is also more
elegant to avoid splits between double consonants or vowels, even if an
hyphenation point do exists between those letters. For example,
<em>pressu-rizar</em> is preferable over <em>pres-surizar</em> and
<em>empreen-dedor</em> is preferable over <em>empre-endedor</em>. Even
so, exceptions exists, it is preferable to partition
<em>micro-organismo</em> rather than <em>microor-ganismo</em> (keeping
morphemes together is favored over splitting a double vowel).</p>
<p>The general rule for Portuguese hyphenation is to split a word into
its syllables. A syllable is made of a mandatory nucleus, filled by a
vowel, and optional peripheral consonants (before or after the nucleus).
In some situations, the syllabic division does not respect the
ethnologic constituents. The usage of the prefixes <em>bis-</em> and
<em>in-</em> are examples of this circumstance. The correct
syllabifications are <em>bi-sa-vô</em>, <em>i-na-ti-vo</em> and
<em>i-nobs-tan-te</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, where the prefixes are split into
two syllables. But, as pointed previously, it is preferable to keep
morphemes together rather than splitting them apart, therefore the we
should favor the hyphenation <em>bisa-vô</em> over <em>bi-savô</em> and
<em>ina-tivo</em> over <em>i-nativo</em>. This last example could also
lead to a misunderstanding since the word <em>nativo</em>
(<em>native</em> in English) emerges from this word break.</p>
<p>Each language has its own hyphenation rules. They might be grouped
into two groups: those which hyphenation is driven by morphology
(etymology) and those driven by pronunciation. An algorithmic approach
might use a logic system to analyse words and apply the hyphenation
rules of a given language. An algorithm must be written for each
language, as hyphenation rules vary extensively. Although a logic system
might be fast and compact, inevitably it will have to deal with
exceptions through hard-coded rules.</p>
<p>The automation of this process might use a dictionary based approach,
which will restrict the hyphenation possibilities to those entries in
the dictionary, an algorithmic base approach, which might be applied to
whatever sequence found in a text, or a mix of bothe approaches. An
algorithmic approach might use a logic system to analyse words and apply
the hyphenation rules of a given language. A rule base model might
include the recognition of prefixes, suffixes, morphemes, or some
sequences suitable for the inclusion of a break. Another approach is the
usage of pattern matching. Given a corpus of hyphenation examples in a
language, it is necessary to identify those sequence of letters that
define a point where hyphenation is suitable or not. Patterns might
include prefixes, suffixes, exceptions and special hyphenation rules of
a given language. Such approach might be used for different languages,
by providing hyphenation examples in a target language to extract
patterns and rules.</p>
<p>Only the analysis of immediate surrounding might not be enough to
determine a potential break point. For example, consider
<em>dem-o-crat</em> and <em>de-moc-ra-cy</em>, where immediate
surrounding of <em>e</em> does not suffice to determine the break
location. Even after chosen patterns that makes hyphenation pretty
straightforward, there might be exceptions. Consider the sequence
<em>tion</em>. It seems safe to always place a break before this
pattern. However, the word <em>cation</em> is hyphenated as
<em>cat-ion</em>, making is etymology determinant to the way this word
will be split.</p>
<p>A word with different meanings may be hyphenated differently
according to its meaning. ‘For instance, the Swedish word form
<em>glassko</em> has three different meanings, and can be hyphenated as
<em>glas-sko</em> (glass shoe), <em>glass-ko</em> (ice cream cow) and in
the non-standard way, <em>glass-sko</em> (ice cream shoe).’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="nemeth2006"></span>. In Portuguese, the
word <em>sublinha</em> might be hiphenated in two different forms:
<em>su-bli-nha</em> when representing the inflected form of verb
<em>sublinhar</em> (underline as a verb) or <em>sub-li-nha</em> when
refering to the line under (underline as a noun).</p>
<p>Machine learning approach was used by to hyphenate Norwegian text
<span class="citation" data-cites="kristensen2001"></span>. It was found
that the TeX approach, in general, performed better then a neural
network. Both approaches had similar performance on finding the correct
hyphenation points and avoiding wrong hyphenation points on a small word
list (the neural network performed slightly better on finding the
correct hyphenation points). Nonetheless, TeX approach overcame the
neural network on a large word list, regarding the avoidance of wrong
hyphenations.</p>
<p>The original TeX hyphenation algorithm was introduced by Knuth 1977
<span class="citation" data-cites="knuth1977"></span>. It was focused on
the English language and used three main rules:(1) suffix removal; (2)
prefix removal; and (3) vowel-consonant-consonant-vowel (vccv) breaking.
Tests showed it could find 40% of the allowed hyphen locations <span
class="citation" data-cites="liang1983"></span>. The hyphenation
algorithm proposed by Frank M. Liang and adopted in TeX uses the notion
of competing patterns. A database of hyphenated words is swept, looking
for hyphenating and inhibiting patterns. The algorithm introduced in
TeX82 uses five alternating levels of hyphenating and inhibiting
patterns. The program for patten generation, based on a corpus, PATGEN
was created Liang <span class="citation"
data-cites="liangbreitenlohner1999"></span> and was used to create
hyphenating patterns for many languages <span class="citation"
data-cites="sojka1995 sojka1995a sojka2005thesis sojka2003 scannell2003"></span>.</p>
<p>The effective hyphenation of words by TeX will actually depends on
the following factors:</p>
<div class="enumerate*">
<p>document language, which will determine which set of patterns to
apply;</p>
<p>characters used, since some might block hyphenation at their
edges;</p>
<p>the value of the internal variables <code>lefthyphenmin</code> and
<code>righthyphenmin</code>, which defines the minimum sequence length
of characters at the left and right borders before any hyphenation is
allowed.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite the fact that TeX hyphenation algorithm and rules are old,
they are, to these days, the most frequently used even outside the TeX’s
world. The grounds for this is Hunspell, a spell checker and
morphological analyzer that is adopted in may software (e.g.
LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird,
Google Chrome, macOS, InDesign, memoQ, Opera, Affinity Publisher, among
others <span class="citation" data-cites="hunspell"></span>). Hunspell
uses TeX hyphenation rules <span class="citation"
data-cites="hunspellhyphen levien1998"></span>, making TeX hyphenation
widespread in the computer world. That is a result of TeX approach
simplicity and versatility. The algorithm works well, it currently has
rules for 66 languages <span class="citation"
data-cites="texhyphenrules"></span> and it is possible to design new
rules for those still missing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some specific hyphenation rules are not possible to be
implemented using the TeX hyphenation algorithm. In German, for example,
when words are hyphenated, some letters might change or a letter might
be inserted. Compound words have no hyphens, leading to long sequences
of letters with no visible separation and even repetitions of a same
letter, such as in <em>Wasserrinne</em> and <em>Schifffahrt</em>.
Furthermore, the German spelling reform made some changes, making it
necessary to create a different set of rules for German hyphenation. For
example, the word <em>Schiffahrt</em> should be hyphenated as
<em>Schiff-fahrt</em>, preserving the <em>f</em>s from each word that
makes this compound. The hyphenation should insert a <em>f</em> that is
not part of the written form. That was not a problem for the old written
form of the word: <em>Schifffahrt</em>. Also, the old hyphenating rules
of German grammar stated the hyphenation <em>Bäk-ker</em> for the word
<em>Bäcker</em>, <em>Zuk-ker</em> for the word <em>Zucker</em> and
<em>pak-ken</em> for the word <em>packen</em>. Now those words are
hyphenated as <em>Bä-cker</em>, <em>Zu-cker</em> and <em>pa-cken</em>,
respectively. Some words have also changed their hyphenation point after
the spelling reform. For example, <em>Fen-ster</em> became
<em>Fens-ter</em>and <em>mei-stens</em> became <em>meis-tens</em>. Some
problems in compound word hyphenation in TeX are discussed in <span
class="citation" data-cites="sojka1995a"></span>.</p>
<h1 id="patterns-for-tex-hyphenation">Patterns for TeX hyphenation</h1>
<p>The patterns used in TeX hyphenation are of the form:
<code>4z1z2</code>. Each pattern is made of a sequence of letters and
numbers. Odd numbers indicate a good hyphenation point, whereas even
numbers indicate a bad place to break. The given example states that the
sequence has a good breaking point between the first and the second
<em>z</em> and an hyphenation should be inhibited before the first
<em>z</em> and after the second <em>z</em>. For example, the hyphenation
of the word <em>piz-za</em>, <em>fiz-zle</em> and <em>mezzanine</em> use
this rule, where we see the hyphen placed between the two <em>z</em>’s
and no hyphen before, nor after the <em>z</em>’s. The pattern may also
use period symbol (<em>.</em>) to indicate word boundaries. The pattern
<code>.s2h2</code> applies to beginning of words, implying that the
<em>s</em> and the <em>h</em> should stick together in beginning of a
word and an hyphenation should also be inhibited after the <em>h</em>.
For example, this pattern is used in <em>Sher-lock</em>.</p>
<p>Hyphenation rules are organized in levels, from 1 to 9, where odd
numbers represent hyphenating levels and even numbers represent
inhibiting levels. Each level works as an exception level of it
predecessor. For example, the rule <code>sh1er</code> indicate a good
hyphenation point between the <em>h</em> and the <em>e</em> in the
sequence <em>sher</em>. A rule at a higher level, as <code>.s2h2</code>,
implies an exception to the lower level rule. When we see <em>sher</em>,
in the beginning of a word, the rule <code>.s2h2</code> applies and
hyphenation proposed by the lower level rule <code>sh1er</code> should
be hindered. That is the case in the hyphenation of the word
<em>Sher-lock</em>. The full example is provided in , where we might see
all English rules that takes place in the hyphenation of
<em>Sher-lock</em>.</p>

<p>A pattern will consist of a string made of characters (from the
language alphabet) possibly with a number in between, expressing the
hyphenation/inhibition level and possibly word boundaries marker (the
period) at the pattern edges. When there is no number between characters
in a pattern, a zero is assumed, which means <em>undefined</em> and no
hyphenation point will be suggest at that location.</p>
<h1 id="patgen">PATGEN</h1>
<p>PATGEN uses a list of hyphenated words to define rules at different
levels and lengths, based on the patterns found in the data. It start
with short patterns and increases until a maximum pattern length,
allowed by the user, is reached. As it advances, creating longer
patterns, it also establishes exceptions. In some cases, the analysis of
long patterns might be necessary, since some hyphenation points might
depend on characters far away from the breaking point<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>PATEGEN works on glyph indices rather than character codes. Each
glyph is represented by a single byte. That amount to 256 indices, where
13 of them are reserved for the digits 0-9 and the characters ‘.’, ‘-’
and ‘*’. The remaining 243 are used to represent symbols of the given
language. To run PATGEN, it is required a translation file, which
defines the values of some language specific parameters (in the first
line) and defines the many forms in which language symbols might appear
(all following lines). In the first line, positions 1 and 2 are used to
set the value of <code>lefthyphenmin</code>, positions 3 and 4 are for
<code>righthyphenmin</code>. These values defines the shortest length of
a string that might be generated by an hyphenation procedure. In order
to set a single digit value, leave the first position blank, that is,
put a blank space in position 1 and 3 for <code>lefthyphenmin</code> and
<code>righthyphenmin</code> respectively. Positions 5, 6 and 7 are used
to define alternative values for the special characters ‘.’, ‘-’ and
‘*’. The following lines uses a delimiter to surround each ‘letter’ of
the desired language alphabet and also its alternative representations.
The first position of the line defines the delimiter and each symbol of
the language may use as many positions as necessary, since not using the
value reserved for the delimiter. Consider the example for defining the
letter ‘e’ in Portuguese:</p>
<pre><code>XeXEXéXêXÉXÊX\&#39;{e}X\^{e}X\&#39;{E}X\^{E}XX </code></pre>
<p>It represents the many ways in which it might be found: lowercase,
uppercase, with or without acute or circumflex accents. In this
definition, we have assumed that the many forms in which we may find the
character <em>e</em> and <em>e</em> will be equivalent for hyphenation
(pattern matching) purpose. As another example, see the line defining
the character <span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> (taken from
<span class="citation" data-cites="haralambous2021"></span>):</p>
<pre><code> #p#P#\varpi ## </code></pre>
<p>The translate file and the dictionary file should use the same
encoding. Even if it is a multi byte encoding, the translation file
express how to deal with a sequence of bytes representing a glyph and
PATGEN will work fine as long as there are at most 243 symbols in the
given language. The dictionary file is a list of already hyphenated
words from which PATGEN will look for patterns and create hyphenation
rules.</p>
<p>Those rules are organized in different levels, from 1 to 9, where odd
numbers represent hyphenating levels and even numbers represent
inhibiting levels. Each level works as an inhibiting level of it
predecessor. A pattern will consist of a string made of characters (from
the language alphabet) possibly with a number in between, expressing the
hyphenation/inhibition level and possibly word boundaries marker (the
period) at the pattern edges. When there is no number between characters
in a pattern, a zero is assumed, which means <em>undefined</em> and no
hyphenation point will be suggest at that location.</p>
<h1 id="sec-tex-hyphen-pt">TeX hyphenation rules for portuguese</h1>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="rezende1987"></span> created the
first patters for Portuguese hyphenation in TeX. It was lastly updated
in 2015 with the contributions from José João Dias Almeida <span
class="citation" data-cites="hyphpt"></span>. The set has rules<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and are able to correctly hyphenate
the majority of Portuguese words.</p>
<p>In front of these cases, we propose here to analyse the performance
of the default rules in order to add new rules to improve hyphenation by
correcting some issues and taking in account non-typical patterns. We
describe the methodology used in the section <a href="#sec-methodology"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec-methodology">5</a>.</p>
<h1 id="sec-methodology">Methodology</h1>
<p>In order to apprise the performance of each set of rules, we need a
list of correctly hyphenated words that are used in Portuguese. For
that, we use the frequency of occurrence to avoid selecting really rare
words. To build a large list with such information, we relied on data
collected from online dictionaries and corpora of Portuguese. We also
looked up Portuguese grammars to check on the hyphenation
(<em>translineation</em>) rules and we made some manual corrections on
the data.</p>
<h2 id="sec-data-coll">Data collection</h2>
<p>Initially we selected <a
href="https://www.linguateca.pt/cetenfolha/index_info.html">CETENFolha</a>
as the source corpus. Using only this corpus led to two problems: many
words were still missing and it was built on text from 1994, prior to
the Orthographic Agreement. This problem is a result of the Orthographic
Agreement of the Portuguese Language, carried out in 1990.</p>
<p>The Agreement’s adopting transition period started in 2009 and ended
as it turned mandatory in 2016. Even after the agreement, some words
still hold different spellings in the participant countries. It is
desirable to have hyphenation rules that might work properly, despite
those idiosyncrasies. For example, the word <em>reception</em> might be
written as <em>receção</em> (Portugal) or <em>recepção</em> (Brazil);
the word <em>action</em> might be written as <em>acção</em> (Portugal)
or <em>ação</em> (Brazil); and the word <em>project</em> might be
written as <em>projecto</em> (Portugal) or <em>projeto</em>
(Brazil).</p>
<p>Because of these idiosyncrasies, we decided to incorporate the list
of words from <a href="https://www.palavras.net/">Palavras NET</a> and
afterwards we also included words from the <a
href="https://pt.wikipedia.org">Portuguese Wikipedia</a> dump. Although
the list of words created was huge, we kept only those words we could
find their hyphenation on at least one of the following online
dictionaries: <a href="https://michaelis.uol.com.br/">Michaelis</a>, <a
href="https://dicionario.priberam.org/">Priberam</a>, <a
href="https://pt.wiktionary.org">Wikcionário</a>, <a
href="https://aulete.com.br/">Aulete</a>, <a
href="http://www.portaldalinguaportuguesa.org/">Portal da Língua
Portuguesa</a> e <a href="https://www.dicio.com.br/">Dicio</a>. This
leads to the creation of a dictionary with words.</p>
<p>Table <a href="#tblstats" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tblstats">1</a> presents the number of words with a
given number of hyphenation found in the dictionaries. It also presents
the number of words that have the highest agreed hyphenation. For
example, the word <em>como</em> was hyphenated by the six dictionaries
as <em>co-mo</em>. It will add one to the counts on both lines where the
hyphenations number is 6 (first column). The word <em>sua</em> was
hyphenated as <em>su-a</em> in 4 dictionaries, <em>sua</em> in one
dictionary and one dictionary did not provide its hyphenation.
Therefore, it will add one in the first line, second column (since
hyphenations were found in 5 dictionaries). It will also add one on the
second line, third column (since the most frequent hyphenation was found
in 4 dictionaries). It is clear now why we might have the number of same
hyphenations (specially for small values) greater the number of
hyphenations found.</p>
<div id="tblstats">

<p>In summary, data from <em>CETENFolha</em> and <em>Palavras NET</em>
were compiled. Their words were hyphenated based on the hyphenation
orignal TeX rules and contrasted with the dictionary results. The
performance was appraised and the errors systematized, in order to find
in the literature possible rules that could complement and improve
it.</p>
<h1 id="grammar-rules-for-hyphenation-in-portuguese">Grammar rules for
hyphenation in Portuguese</h1>
<p>There is a wide range of writing systems, including logographic,
syllabic, and alphabetic writing systems. We might group the writing
systems into three cateories: alphabetic, phonemic and logographic.
Although they are distinct categories, some writing systems be built on
an interplay of these categories <span class="citation"
data-cites="coulmas2003"></span>. The principles that guide an
alphabetic writing system or a phonemic writing system can vary
significantly based on the specific language and its history, but we
might highlight some of the key points:</p>
<div class="enumerate*">
<p>the most usual principle consists on representing the sounds of a
language with written symbols, using one or a combination of symbols to
represent each sound (e.g. the orthographic system of Portuguese uses an
alphabet of 27 letters that aim to represent different sounds of the
language);</p>
<p>etymology also plays an important role, where the spelling of a word
reflects its origins and history (e.g. the French language often
reflects the Latin roots of words in its spelling);</p>
<p>morphology is used as a guide in structuring many languages, where
they use specific letters or symbols to indicate word endings, prefixes,
or suffixes (e.g. Russian uses different forms of the Cyrillic alphabet
to indicate gender and case in its nouns);</p>
<p>the way a language has evolved over time also contribute (e.g. the
spelling of many English words has changed over time to reflect changes
in pronunciation);</p>
</div>
<p>The principles that guide orthographic systems for languages with
logographic writing systems like Chinese ideograms, cuneiform writing,
and Egyptian hieroglyphs differ significantly from those of alphabetic
writing systems. In logographic writing systems, individual symbols or
characters represent entire words or ideas rather than phonemes or
sounds. As a result, the principles that guide their orthographic
systems are based more on semantic and visual principles rather than
phonemic principles.</p>
<p>As a result of the alphabetical writing system of the Portuguese, its
spelling is guided by phonological principles <span class="citation"
data-cites="cagliari2015"></span>. The fact that spelling reflects, to
some extent, the way words are pronounced, means that the hyphenation of
words is also influenced by the phonemic system, where words are divided
into syllables. It is noteworthy that different languages divide words
based on different principles, for example, English tends to be guided
by morphological principles, such as <em>walk-ing</em>,
<em>un-happy</em>, <em>work-s</em> and <em>ear-ly</em>. Also, other
factors affect word hyphenation in English, such as the presence of
doubled consonants and digraphs. There are also a myriad of exceptions
that might be grasped into rules.</p>
<p>Merely stating that an orthographic system is guided by phonological
issues does not necessarily mean that its hyphenation rules directly
reflect the way a word is pronounced. This is because the orthographic
system operates according to its own specific rules. For instance,
although vowel clusters that produce a single sound (i.e., digraphs) are
pronounced within a single syllable in words like <em>chave</em>,
<em>ilha</em>, <em>shampoo</em>, <em>carro</em>, and <em>bird</em>,
their representation in writing determines how they are separated.
Specifically, different consonants within a digraph must remain
together, while different consonants are separated. As a result, we have
<em>i-lha</em> but <em>car</em>.</p>
<p>In Portuguese, hyphenations are allowed on syllables boundaries and,
in general, follow phonological principles. According to the Grammar
<span class="citation"
data-cites="cunha2016 bergstrom2011 cegalla2008"></span>, some rules
might still apply:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span id="rule-di-triphthong" label="rule-di-triphthong"></span>
diphthong or triphthong should not be split (e.g.
<em>m<u><em>ui</em></u>-to</em>,
<em>Pa-ra-g<u><em>uai</em></u></em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-unstressed" label="rule-unstressed"></span> the
sequences <em>ia</em>, <em>ie</em>, <em>io</em>, <em>oa</em>,
<em>ua</em>, <em>ue</em> and <em>uo</em>, when in final unstressed
position, should not be split (e.g. <em>gló-r<u><em>ia</em></u></em>,
<em>vi-tó-r<u><em>ia</em></u></em>, <em>cá-r<u><em>ie</em></u></em>,
<em>es-pé-c<u><em>ie</em></u></em>, <em>Má-r<u><em>io</em></u></em>,
<em>má-g<u><em>oa</em></u></em>, <em>ré-g<u><em>ua</em></u></em>,
<em>tê-n<u><em>ue</em></u></em>, <em>con-tí-g<u><em>uo</em></u></em>,
<em>am-bí-g<u><em>uo</em></u></em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-c-clusters" label="rule-c-clusters"></span>
consonant clusters starting a syllable should not be split (e.g.
<em><u><em>pn</em></u>eu-má-ti-co</em>,
<em><u><em>ps</em></u>i-có-lo-go</em>,
<em><u><em>mn</em></u>e-mô-ni-co</em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rules-digraphs-ns" label="rules-digraphs-ns"></span>
the digraphs<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>ch</em>, <em>lh</em>,
<em>nh</em>, <em>gu</em>, <em>qu</em> should not be split (e.g.
<em>ra-<u><em>ch</em></u>ar</em>, <em>a-bro-<u><em>lh</em></u>os</em>,
<em>ma-<u><em>nh</em></u>ã</em>, <em><u><em>gu</em></u>i-tar-ra</em>,
<em><u><em>qu</em></u>in-to</em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-guqu" label="rule-guqu"></span> bigrams like
<em>gu</em> and <em>qu</em> whose vowel <em>u</em> is not pronounced are
never separated from the vowel or diphthong that follows it (e.g.
<em>ne-<u><em>gu</em>e</u></em>,
<em>pe-<u><em>qu</em>e</u></em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-nasalization" label="rule-nasalization"></span>
since they are digraphs, a vowel and its following nasalization marker
(a graphic nasal consonant) should not be split (e.g.
<em><u><em>am</em></u>-bição</em>,
<em>m<u><em>an</em></u>-cha</em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-decreasing" label="rule-decreasing"></span>
decreasing diphthongs should not be split (e.g.
<em><u><em>ai</em></u>-ro-so</em>, <em>ca-d<u><em>ei</em></u>-ra</em>,
<em>o-ra-ç<u><em>ão</em></u></em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-rising" label="rule-rising"></span> rising
diphthong should not be split (e.g. <em>a-b<u><em>ai</em></u>-xo</em>;
<em>c<u><em>au</em></u>-te-la</em>, <em>pa-p<u><em>éi</em></u>s</em>,
<em>cha-p<u><em>éu</em></u></em>, <em>pre-f<u><em>ei</em></u>-to</em>,
<em>r<u><em>eu</em></u>-nir</em>, <em>n<u><em>oi</em></u>-te</em>;
<em>ca-la-b<u><em>ou</em></u>-ço</em>,
<em>as-te-r<u><em>ói</em></u>-de</em>;
<em>re-tri-b<u><em>ui</em></u></em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-singlev" label="rule-singlev"></span> disyllables
whose syllable has a single vowel should not be split (e.g.
<em><u><em>a</em></u>to</em>, <em>ru<u><em>a</em></u></em>,
<em><u><em>ó</em></u>dio</em>, <em><u><em>u</em></u>nha</em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-orphan" label="rule-orphan"></span> words with
more than two syllables, when divided, cannot isolate a syllable
composed of a single vowel (e.g. <em><u><em>a</em></u>gos-to</em>,
<em>la-go<u><em>a</em></u></em>, <em><u><em>i</em></u>da-de</em>);</p>
<p>to 5cm<span>to 10pt<span>. </span></span></p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-hiatus" label="rule-hiatus"></span> hiatus vowels
and those vowel sequences where each vowel belongs to a different
syllable should be split (e.g. <em>sa<u><em>-ú-</em></u>de</em>,
<em>ra<u><em>-i-</em></u>nha</em>, <em>d<u><em>o-e</em></u>r</em>,
<em>v<u><em>o-o</em></u>s</em>), the same procedure is used splitting
diphthongs in different syllables (e.g.
<em>c<u><em>ai-ai</em></u>s</em>) or diphthong and vowel in different
syllables (e.g. <em>en-s<u><em>ai-o</em></u>s</em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-consonants" label="rule-consonants"></span>
consonant sequences, when in different syllables, should be split (e.g.
<em>a<u><em>f-t</em></u>a</em>, <em>a<u><em>b-d</em></u>i-car</em>,
<em>re<u><em>s-c</em></u>i-são</em>,
<em>a<u><em>b-s</em></u>o-lu-to</em>);</p></li>
<li><p><span id="rule-digraphs" label="rule-digraphs"></span> the
following consonant digraphs should be split: <em>rr</em>, <em>ss</em>,
<em>mm</em>, <em>nn</em>, <em>sc</em>, <em>sç</em> and <em>xc</em> (e.g.
<em>te<u><em>r-r</em></u>a</em>, <em>pro-fe<u><em>s-s</em></u>or</em>,
<em>co-mu<u><em>m-m</em></u>en-te</em>,
<em>co<u><em>n-n</em></u>os-co</em>, <em>de<u><em>s-c</em></u>er</em>,
<em>cre<u><em>s-ç</em></u>a</em>,
<em>e<u><em>x-c</em></u>e-der</em>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In some situations a hyphen should be repeated in the start of the
following line:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>when a compound word using a hyphen is split across lines (e.g.
<em>couve-/-flor</em>, <em>ex-/-presidente</em>);</p></li>
<li><p>when a different meaning could be conveyed when splitting a
pronoun (e.g. <em>prazer de ver-/-me</em><a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It should be avoided to leave a single vowel in the end or start of a
line (e.g. the word <em>san-guí-nea</em> should be split only on the
hyphen gave in the example, avoiding the split that would leave the
final vowel <em>a</em> left alone in the start of a new line:
<em>sanguíne-a</em>). It is also considered a better approach to avoid
splitting disyllables made of four letters (e.g. <em>para</em>,
<em>como</em>, <em>cede</em>).</p>
<p>Systematizing the rules that guide syllable boundarie and,
consequently, hyphenation in Portuguese proved to be fundamental for the
improvement of the TeX hyphenator rules, since they indicate the
possible or prohibited contexts of hyphenation. Expomos, a seguir, uma
análise comparativa...</p>

<p>Foi criado um conjunto de 37798 palavras obtidas do corpus <a
href="https://www.linguateca.pt/cetenfolha/index_info.html">CETENFolha</a>,
juntamente com palavras do <a href="https://www.palavras.net/">Palavras
NET</a> e algumas palavras do corpus baseado na <a
href="https://pt.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>. Foram mantidas apenas as
palavras para as quais encontrou-se a hifenização nos seguintes
dicionários online: <a
href="https://michaelis.uol.com.br/">Michaelis</a>, <a
href="https://dicionario.priberam.org/">Priberam</a>, <a

href="http://www.portaldalinguaportuguesa.org/">Portal da Língua
Portuguesa</a> e <a href="https://www.dicio.com.br/">Dicio</a>. Adotamos
como hifenização ‘correta’ aquela que ao menos 4 dicionários
concordavam. Algumas hifenizações foram realizadas manualmente pelo
autor. Considerando a frequência de ocorrência das palavras nos corpus,
o conjuto de palavras escolhido representa 55% do total das ocorrências
relativo ao Wikipedia e 58% em relação ao CETENFolha. Este percentual é
relativamente baixo, mas deve-se ao fato de que não obtivemos sucesso em
encontrar a hifenização de muitas palavras nos dicionários analisados e
também por não observarmos um consenso de ao menos 4 dicionários com uma
mesma hifenização.</p>
<p>Analisando os erros resultantes da hifenização utilizando as regras
padrão do TeX, foram estabelecidas algumas regras como forma de abarcar
um conjunto maior de palavras. Tais regras são elencadas a seguir,
